StarWars DataBase was created for the learning project.
Most solutions and approaches were made by my teacher [Juriy](https://github.com/Juriy) from course [React+Redux](https://www.udemy.com/pro-react-redux/)
This project not finished and I will add my own decisions.
API from site https://swapi.co 

For now:
+ pages for items list (little work with API)
+ add search panel
+ add films directory

Known issues:
- search element and change-page elements visible on films page
